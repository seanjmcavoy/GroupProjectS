# PathQueue (Working Title)

A grid-based puzzle where you **plan** a sequence of W/A/S/D moves, then press Enter to **execute** and watch a little cube robot follow the plan. Tiles change the rules (ice, sticky, walls, goal), so thinking ahead is key.

## Project structure (systems)

- **GridManager** – Builds a dictionary of tiles from 	ilesRoot. Converts grid <-> world using cellSize.
- **PlayerController** – Executes the queued commands step-by-step on the grid (lerped movement). Handles tile reactions (slide, sticky, hazards, goal).
- **CommandQueue** – Stores the planned commands; simple API for Add/Pop/Clear and an OnChanged event for UI.
- **GameManager** – Planning/execution loop: records W/A/S/D, Backspace, Enter/Space, R. Blocks input while Win UI is shown.
- **Tiles**
  - Tile (base): Manages walkability, OnEnter, automatic tinting, and optional SFX/particle feedback hooks.
  - WallTile: Not walkable.
  - GoalTile: Calls player.CompleteLevel() and opens Win UI (tinted green).
  - IceTile: Sets slide direction so the player keeps moving straight until a non-ice tile (icy blue tint).
  - StickyTile: Consumes extra commands before the player can move off (amber tint).
  - FireTile: Immediate reset on contact (hot red tint).
  - GlassTile: Fragile reset trigger (pale cyan tint).
  - SpringTile: Launches the player forward/back for a configurable number of tiles.
  - RisingTile: Cycles up/down automatically for timed obstacles (toggle auto-cycle off to trigger manually).
- **WinUI** – A "You Won!" panel with Restart/Next Level buttons. Pauses time when shown.
- **Editor/TileTools** – Editor menu utilities for bulk converting selected floor cubes between all tile types.
- **AI Systems**
  - AIChaser: Grid-aware enemy that continually replans a path to the player using the shared pathfinder and triggers a reset on contact.
  - HintPathVisualizer: Runs a stateful HintSimulator (A* + tile-effect simulation) to highlight a valid command sequence on demand.

## Scenes & level flow

- Scenes are named Level_00, Level_01, Level_02, etc.
- Add them to **File > Build Settings** in order.

## Recent additions

- Tile tinting is automatic per tile type with optional overrides in the Inspector.
- Tile SFX now use configurable volume/pitch and play as 2D audio by default so feedback is clearer.
- Rising tiles support continuous cycles (configurable timings) for timed puzzles, while still supporting manual activation when desired.
- Editor conversion menus expose every tile type from the top bar, hierarchy, and component context menus for faster level authoring.
- Added AI helpers: a chaser enemy that uses grid pathfinding, and an on-demand hint system that simulates real tile effects (slide, sticky, rising, spring) to display a safe path.
- Level 11 roadmap: AI-assisted 10×10 procedural generator that rerolls layouts on click, validates solvability with the pathfinder, respects difficulty knobs, and can expose RNG seeds for reproducible runs.
